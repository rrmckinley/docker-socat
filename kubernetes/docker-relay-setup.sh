# This shell script sets up the docker-socat relay on each node in a kubernetes
# cluster. You can run it again to set up a newer image.
#
# This script should work on any machine running Linux or MacOSX, but it 
# was tested only on Ubuntu 14.04 and Mac OS X Yosemite and Mavericks.
# It should correctly configure on any Kubernetes cluster, but it was tested
# only with clusters running on AWS running Ubuntu 15.04.
#
# *** IMPORTANT ***
# This script must be run from directory where you cloned the docker-socat
# repository, so ./docker-socat/kubernetes/docker-socat-setup.sh is
# the path to the installation script.
# 
# To explicitly set the number of minions, you should set the environment
# variable NUM_MINIONS. The default is to set NUM_MINIONS to the number
# of nodes in your cluster as reported by Kubernetes.
#
# You may specify an explicit path to Kubernetes binaries, which is an optional
# parameter of this script.
#
# This script will restart the docker-socat relay using the latest
# container built in the working directory.
#
# The script will print "ALL DONE" if it completed the setup successfully.
# The script will print "FAILED" in case of a failure.
